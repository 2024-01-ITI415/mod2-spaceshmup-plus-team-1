As a member of the team responsible for enemy adjustments, my contributions were focused on enhancing the gameplay experience by fine-tuning enemy stats to better fit the game's space-themed aesthetic and overall balance.

For early-game balance, I reduced the speed of Enemy_0 and Enemy_1. This change allows early heroes to upgrade their capabilities before these enemies can escape, providing a more engaging progression.
I increased the speed of Enemy_2, who pose a significant threat by appearing from the sides of the screen. This adjustment keeps them active on the screen, attempting to target the hero.
Enemy_3, designed as an assassin attacking from the front, had its HP significantly reduced. The original high HP combined with its mechanics of exiting the screen post-attack made it nearly impossible for the hero to defeat, which was deemed unreasonable.
Enemy_4 now attempts to flee after losing a part. In the original version, Enemy_4 would often clutter the game, creating a sense of discomfort, especially when it was in parts.

The adjustments ensure that the hero can smoothly obtain items without necessitating an increase or change in the current weapon's value. This includes improvements to movement speed, drop probability, and a more balanced score distribution. Although I did not implement a UI（Not my part） to display the score, the functionality should be intact.
